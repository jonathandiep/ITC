## System Requirements
Design and develop a website to allow people to post their service requests and allow service providers to bid on the services. The website is free to both clients and service providers and is not involved with (making or receiving) payments for the services. The key requirements of the website are described below.

### User

| Search service requests             | As a user, I can services requests by keyword. |
| Create an account                   | As a user, I can create an account and become a registered user so that I can post a service request, bid on a service request, or do both. |
| View comments to a client           | As a user, I can view comments and ratings which service providers gave to a client. |
